             This is about building a working system that assists with  <i> real-time, granular </i> software QA. 
             More specifically the system assesses individual code commits, as any piece of code is committed into a repository, 
             for the risk of a fault down the road (further on in development). That assessment is based on various characteristics about (i) the individual code commit itself, and (ii) 
             the characteristics of the developers associated with the code and is arrived at using machine learning.

             <br>
                <br>
             The overall objective is to employ machine learning, and data, to improve the efficiency in identifying "risky" i.e., 
           likely to fault pieces of code, and in a dynamic "as-the-project-evolves" manner.

             There are interesting machine learning applications including sparse classification, anomaly detection, and risk prediction to be explored.
             This exercise also offers a practical experience with the implications of the <i> no-free-lunch-theorem-of-machine-learning </i>
