             This is about building a working system that assists with  <font color="slateblue"> real-time, granular </font> software QA. 
             More specifically, the system assesses individual <font color="slateblue">code commits</font>font>, as any piece of code is committed into an
                an evolving software project (repository), 
             for the <font color="slateblue">risk of a fault </font>font>down the road. That assessment is based on various characteristics regarding
                (i) an individual code commit itself, and (ii) the characteristics of the developers associated with the code and that particular code commit.
                This fault risk assessment is arrived at, using machine learning.

             <br>
                <br>
             The overall objective is to employ machine learning and data, to improve the efficiency in identifying risky i.e., 
           likely to fault pieces of code in a software project, in a dynamic "as-the-software-project-evolves" manner.

    The objective is to realize a working <i>privacy-preserving federated machine learning </i> environment, over 
    a collection of related but otherwise distributed collection of multiple databases, in the clinical domain.

    <br> The machine learning concepts to understand, apply, and explore include <i>
     federated machine learning, privacy-preservation, the utility-privacy tradeoff</i> and <i>homomorphic-encryption</i>
    <br>
Skill stack: tensor-flow federated (platform), pysyft (differential privacy), pyseal (homorphic encryption)
Project material: zip folder 
with pointer to open de-identified collection of health data tables, 
suggested analysis tasks over the FML solution developed, 
and a plan for the empirical evaluation of the utility-vs-privacy tradeoff.
