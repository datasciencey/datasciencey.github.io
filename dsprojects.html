    <h2 class="rbt">Project 1: Automated Software Risk Assessment with Machine Learning</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
        This is about building a working system that assists with <i>real-time, granular</i> software QA.
        More specifically, the system assesses individual <i>code commits</i>, as any piece of code is committed into
        an evolving software project (repository), for the <i>risk of a fault</i> down the road. That assessment is based on various characteristics regarding
        (i) an individual code commit itself, and (ii) the characteristics of the developers associated with the code and that particular code commit.
        This fault risk assessment is arrived at, using machine learning.

        <br><br>
        The overall objective is to employ machine learning and data, to improve the efficiency in identifying risky i.e., likely to fault pieces of code in a software project, in a dynamic "as-the-software-project-evolves" manner.

        <br><br>
        This exercise offers interesting machine learning explorations including <i>sparse classification, anomaly detection, and automated machine learning</i>;
        and experience across the gamut of machine learning classifiers, with algorithms of (highly) varying complexity, illustrates the
        <i>no-free-lunch-theorem-of-machine-learning</i> playing out in practice.

    <h2 class="rbt">Project 3: Machine Reading of Scientific Research Literature</h2>
    <p class="project-description" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        The objectived is to develop a <i> structured database</i>, of materials science experimental data, <i>from the text</i> of multiple research papers in materials science.
        Researchers require such aggregated and structured databases for data-driven scientific research, however currently a majority of the curation is done by hand.

        <br><br> The machine learning concepts to be explored are all NLP centric:  <i>information extraction: entity extraction, relation extraction</i>,
        and the potential integration of scientific <i>ontologies (knowledge graphs)</i>. Further, the application
        of LLMs for these problems, but in an <i>efficient, cost-effective </i> manner. Encouraged to look at techniques like
        <i>model distillation</i>, for achieving an effective yet cost-efficient model.
