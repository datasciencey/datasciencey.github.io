    <li> 
    This is a collection of projects in various, and of high current practical interest, areas in data science.
        <ol>
            <li>
                Project 1 is about automated assistance with improving the software quality of large software projects.
            </li>
            <li> Project 2 is on building a machine-learning environment over a collection of multiple data sources, <br>
                and under data-privacy concerns.
                <li> Project 3 is a natural language processing (NLP) application assisting with scientific discovery.
                    <li> Project 4 is a research investigation in knowledge graph analytics that is aided by LLMs.

    <li>
        I highly recommend having a textbook as companion through any project.

             In my opinion <a href="https://www.bishopbook.com/">Deep Learning: Fundamentals and Concepts</a> 
         <i>(Bishop & Bishop, free on-line version)</i> <br>
            is excellent (of course there are others).

                <li> 
                    With the exception of any aspect where you are applying LLMs where everything, pedagogical <br>
                    material included, evolves by the day.

    <h2 class="rbt">Project 1: Automated Software Risk Assessment with Machine Learning</h2>
    <p class="project-description">
        This is about building a working system that assists with <i>real-time, granular</i> software QA.
        More specifically, the system assesses individual <i>code commits</i>, as any piece of code is committed into
        an evolving software project (repository), for the <i>risk of a fault</i> down the road. That assessment is based on various characteristics regarding
        (i) an individual code commit itself, and (ii) the characteristics of the developers associated with the code and that particular code commit.
        This fault risk assessment is arrived at, using machine learning.

        <br><br>
        The overall objective is to employ machine learning and data, to improve the efficiency in identifying risky i.e., likely to fault pieces of code in a software project, in a dynamic "as-the-software-project-evolves" manner.

        <br><br>
        This exercise offers interesting machine learning explorations including <i>sparse classification, anomaly detection, and automated machine learning</i>;
        and experience across the gamut of machine learning classifiers, with algorithms of (highly) varying complexity, illustrates the
        <i>no-free-lunch-theorem-of-machine-learning</i> playing out in practice.
